## Eating at Stanford
### Dining halls
These are student restaurants across the campus. They cost $10 for lunch and $12 for dinner, under an all-you-can-eat format. Check out Arrillaga, Wilbur, Lakeside. Arrillaga has great cookies üôÇ. If you‚Äôre broke, bring an empty lunchbox at lunch and save some food for the dinner. 

### Cafeterias
Much fancier than the dining halls but overall more expensive, especially if you need to eat a lot. 


## Finding a room around campus
### Student houses like EVGR, Rains etc
You don‚Äôt have access to on-campus student housing if you‚Äôre just doing your master‚Äôs thesis here or being a research assistant. You need to be a proper student (undergrad, master‚Äôs, Ph.D). You might find an ad to sublet a room there from a student but it‚Äôs not common. 

### Shared houses, homestay
If you‚Äôre looking for / offering a room in a shared house or at someone‚Äôs, check out supost.com, facebook marketplace and the VSR chat. Craigslist might also be a good option but you find weirder stuff there. A reasonable price to pay for a room is $1,100 to $1,800 a month (you might find a $850 room one in a blue moon but don‚Äôt count too much on it).

### Renting your own house
If no rooms are available, find a couple of friends and start your own house! Find some people to rent with and check zillow.com to find house ads. You‚Äôll need a US phone number and social security number for at least one of the applicants to apply on Zillow. Leases are typically for a year but you can negotiate for 6 months. You‚Äôll need to show that you can pay (paychecks or a furnished bank account). 

Houses are cheaper in East Palo Alto. It‚Äôs a bit less fancy neighborhood but they are more tolerant with parties and living there for 9 months now I‚Äôve never heard about any accident. 


## Visas

### H1b lottery
To get a permanent job in a company, you‚Äôll ultimately seek the H1b. A company has to put your name in the annual lottery (in March), and if your name gets drawn, you can start working in ~september. Check out https://formally.com/, a Stanford startup to help you through that process. 
If you have a PhD, you can self-sponsor yourself (e.g. you don‚Äôt need a company). 


### J1 
Note that multiple J1 categories exist. The ‚ÄúJ1 Short-term scholar‚Äù cannot be extended beyond 6 month. If you are at Stanford for more than 6 month, you get a ‚ÄúJ1 Scholar‚Äù - this one can be extended. So you might want to ask your professor to make your stay 6.5 months instead of 6 months, if extension is an option you would like to keep.


### J1 intern / J1 trainee 
If you‚Äôre on a J1 already, check if the two years rule applies to you. It should be written on your passport. If it doesn‚Äôt, you can qualify for another J1 visa. If it does, there are ways around it (one way is to ask your country's embassy in DC to issue you a No-Objection-Letter).

You can apply for a J1 intern visa if you‚Äôre still a student from outside the US or if you graduated within the last 12 months: https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/intern-program.
You can apply for a J1 trainee visa if you have worked abroad for at least 12 months after your graduation. https://j1visa.state.gov/programs/trainee.

Note: a classic scenario to get an H1b visa is to get a J1 first and have your company like you enough to apply for the H1b.

## Health Insurance

Cardinal Care is expensive and can be waived. The procedure for this was changed for Fall 2023 - it has become more difficult to waive. Let‚Äôs list insurances that were accepted for waiving Cardinal Care after August 2023.

### List of insurances that work for waiving Cardinal Care after August 2023:

[ISO Care Elite for Stanford University](https://api.isoa.org/docs/plans/2024/ISO_Care_Elite_2023_2024.pdf) From the [International Student Insurance](https://www.isoa.org/), it cost me $863 for seven months. Perhaps the cheaper plans also work for waiving Cardinal Care, but no guarantee. 

For waiving, you need your SUNet ID and email address, i.e. access to Axess. This means you can only waive Cardinal Care after your first day at work retrospectively (I had access to Axess before starting though). You have 30 (double-check pls?) days time to waive. If your first waiver is denied you have multiple attempts until the deadline. 

## Phone number
Your best deal might be to keep your European phone number.
However, for some usages such as renting a house on Zillow or taking a car insurrance, a US phone number can be useful. 
Mint is $15/m for all illimited: http://fbuy.me/uHNRF (I get some $$$ if uou use that link). Every 3 months just reapply for a new discovery plan. 


## Driver‚Äôs license
### Can I keep my driver‚Äôs license from Europe?
Yes.

### Can I get a driver‚Äôs license as a J1-scholar?
Yes, if you have a social security number. Source: https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/living/driving

## Fun in Palo Alto
Note: bring your ID! They will ALWAYS ask for it and a picture won‚Äôt work. 

### Restaurants
Ramen Nagi: great but plan on queuing a lot
Cafe Venezia: good italian food and it‚Äôs cheaper if you are (speak) italian 

### Clubs
The patio: Karaoke on Wednesday nights. Sometimes there are some events from the GSB. They have food. Overall your only option in Palo Alto, otherwise go to SF ;) 
The French House: obviously the best place to party in south bay ;) It‚Äôs my shared house where we organize one party +/- every 2 months

## Fun in SF
Clubs
Monroe: very European, cheap drinks if you come early. Be there before 8:30 pm or expect a long queue. 
## Networking & Hackathons
### Generative AI events
[Generative AI Events [by cerebralvalley.ai]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P6ut7vL-gXKbeDeh3nuPqBjoCupjIt87Sw7TnhumBSU/edit#gid=1799694959)

## Surfing
The two surfing spots near Stanford are [Pleasure Point](https://www.google.com/maps/place/pleasure+point/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x808e15163516a7b7:0x8c550e2a2643e29f?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwixwZOU8aeBAxUVPkQIHTyJAWAQ8gF6BAgREAA&ved=2ahUKEwixwZOU8aeBAxUVPkQIHTyJAWAQ8gF6BAgTEAE) and [Pacifica](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pacifica,+CA/@37.6164937,-122.5203353,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x808f772fd14a9679:0x44b02f7f17a1c438!8m2!3d37.6327914!4d-122.4900652!16zL20vMHI1dzI?entry=ttu). For both you have shops nearby to rent a suit and a surfing board ($40 altogether, cheaper if you have your own suit). 
## Cars
### Finding a car
Check out SUpost.com, ads in the VSR group, and facebook marketplace. Always have a mechanic do a presale inspection so you know what work needs to be done and how much it will cost you (can be leveraged during negotiation and costs 80$ at Ali‚Äôs auto care)

### Finding a good garage
Ali‚Äôs auto care:
https://maps.google.com?q=Ali's%20Auto%20Care,%202211%20Monroe%20St,%20Santa%20Clara,%20CA%2095050,%20United%20States&ftid=0x808fca3bc7d60be7:0x7ca195e245019dc0&hl=en-US&gl=us&entry=gps&lucs=,47071704&g_st=ic
Great guy, prices are good for a garage. Some things are difficult to fix like problems with the engines but many things are easy to do on your own like oil change or brake change just look your model up on YouTube and buy the parts on Amazon.
## Groceries
Trader Joe‚Äôs: good wine there, overall I like the quality of the products. Human-scaled. You can find original stuff.
Walmart: huge supermarket, cheap, with many items being locked to avoid being stolen
Target: expensive for what it is
The market at Edgewood: high-standing European products. Great if you want that specific piece of cheese or chocolate. 
Grocery outlet: great price-product ratio, but small sortiment 
## Bike 
### Buy / sell
Check out supost.com, the VSR group and facebook marketplace. A typical range is $100 to $300. To sell, you can check https://www.campusbikeshop.com/. 

### Repair
Palo Alto Bicycles: it was $40 to change a tire and brakes. Cheapest option remains to do it yourself while buying what‚Äôs needed on Amazon. 
## Miscellaneous
### June 5th to July 4th are noisy in East Palo Alto
There are a couple of houses in EPA that enjoy fireworks. And when I say enjoy, I mean explosions all the time in June, at least in EPA. That‚Äôs something to consider if you planned on writing your thesis by then.

### Weed is legal in California
You can buy edibles next to the Patio for ex: [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mac's+Smoke+Shop+Inc/@37.444828,-122.1634953,19.38z/data=!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sthe+patio!3m5!1s0x808fbb3a1c256f1d:0x7c4b2b2f8b480369!8m2!3d37.4441776!4d-122.1622516!16s%2Fg%2F1tg68bjw?entry=ttu)https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mac's+Smoke+Shop+Inc/@37.444828,-122.1634953,19.38z/data=!4m9!1m2!2m1!1sthe+patio!3m5!1s0x808fbb3a1c256f1d:0x7c4b2b2f8b480369!8m2!3d37.4441776!4d-122.1622516!16s%2Fg%2F1tg68bjw?entry=ttu)
